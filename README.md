hello everyone!
I wanted to do some project without the confusion of webdev, so i got the idea to do this algorithm visualizer in C++ using SDL.
I'll be making my own little memory allocator to help me understand how memory and pointers work too. 
if your seeing this,thank you for your time and just ignore the bad code :).
